# Beats - Play your Music
A simple Rhythm Game implemented in Unity. The goal is to hit Notes as they fall down. You can import your own MP3 Files to create new Songs and play them. See description below for further information.

## Getting started
Download the project and run it in Unity (01_StartScene).
There are initially two examples implemented ('GuitarBeat' and 'PinkHouseBeat') with some sample beats that were created with Garageband.
To add new music just copy the mp3 file to Assets>Resources>Music. You can then start the game and hit 'Create New Song' in the game to create your own Notes. Afterwards you will see them in your Setlist and can start to play.

## Requirements
- Unity 2019.2.19f1
- Only tested on Windows10
